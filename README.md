# Lin_reg_car_data_project
### Linear Regression problem for car price predictions

This project creates 2 linear regression algorithms for comparison (1 with adjusted polynomial values)

This will be deployed using an AWS EC2 instance which will be linked.

To recreate, run jupyter lab notebooks in numbered order 1-4

Datasets are labelled with the corresponding number within the script they were created.
